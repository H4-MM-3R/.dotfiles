      "description": "World explorer Augustus Skinner has died. Now, his three teen grandsons have inherited the big, old Skinner Mansion and its contents. But Grandpa Skinner also left them a big surprise - the Skinner Boys are now Guardians of the Lost Secrets - a collection of unique artefacts across the world that possess incredible powers. An even bigger surprise is in store. Grandpa Skinner also appointed a fourth Guardian, their feisty teenage cousin, Tara. As these boys know almost nothing about girls - she's probably their biggest challenge of all. And vice-versa. As the anonymous Guardians of these artefacts, Tara and the boys must dedicate their lives to protecting them against the forces that would use their powers for evil and endanger the planet. In the wrong hands, the Rixa Ruby, which has the ability to create great con ict or harmony, could give its owner the power to start wars. Or the Drums of Doom, which when played in the right order can hypnotise the whole world via computers. This is the legacy of Grandpa Skinner. But these unsuspecting kids have a secret weapon - their youth. Nobody would ever guess that these awesome teens would be capable of outsmarting the powerful evil of the Shadowy League and in turn protect the world. It's like handing the keys to the world to an erratic teenager. Times four. Based on the original concept created by Steve Lyons.",

The 1980s brought not only freedom, but also waves of crime on the city streets. While some young people began to ‘grow up’ on the streets, others found it difficult to find their place in this unpredictable reality. Andrey, lives with his mother and five-year-old sister. He studies at a music school and often encounters street teenagers who harass him. To protect himself, Andrey makes friends with one of these teenagers, Marat, who introduces him to gang life. Youth groups fight for every piece of territory; they defend their right to live the life, even breaking laws and promises. The only thing that matters to them is the vows they make to their gang members-brothers, with whom they confront the violence and fears of the adult world.",
