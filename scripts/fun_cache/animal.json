Between climate change and the 6th mass extinction of wildlife, their world could well be inhabitable 50 years from now. They have sounded the alarm over and over, but nothing has really changed. So they’ve decided to tackle the root of the problem: our relationship with the living world. Over the course of an extraordinary journey, they come to realize just how deeply humans are tied to all other living species. And that by saving them… we’re also saving ourselves. Humans thought they could distance themselves from nature, but humans are part and parcel of nature. For man is, after all, an Animal.",

This series is hosted by Jack Hanna, Director Emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. It is shown weekly in syndication across the country on numerous stations and networks.\n\nIt is particularly popular in part because of Hanna's mainstream name recognition as an animal expert, but also because the show meets programing criteria for federally mandated educational and informational requirements which all stations must follow. Because of this, some networks air the show five days per week, thus covering all but a half hour of the three-hour E/I mandate.",

      "description": "Made over a two-year period, Animal is a detailed journey through the Spanish geography in search of examples of a subject as concrete as it is horrifying: festivities where animals are hurt. From the classic bullfighting tradition, to all different kinds of celebration, the movie approaches the humiliations animals are subjected to. This long journey includes visits to different towns, from Madrid to the Ebro Delta. It’s all about watching this images outside the popular context, inside a horror film festival, and wonder about the disturbing and essential difference in relation with images of violence in other films: fiction vs reality.",
